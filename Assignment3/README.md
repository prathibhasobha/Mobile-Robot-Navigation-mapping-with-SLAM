  **Steps Taken:**

•	Make appropriate changes to codes mainly,mobile_robot.urdf, mobile_robot.urdf.bak and mobilr_robot.urdf.xacro.
•	For chasis ,length,width and height  is determined as 0.3048m,0.2032m and 0.127m and wheel dimensions are .1024m,0.1270and 
            0.724m.
•	Implemented jetson nano on chassis and Lidar on jetson nano.
•	Jetson nano with box size of 0.2m,0.16m and 0.06m
•	Lidar with box size of 0.17m ,0.1m and 0.06m

•	Run mobile_robot.launch ,thus robot 3D visualization will be obtained.

•	Running the drive launch file will lead to gazebo tool. Gazebo is a powerful open-source simulation tool commonly used in conjunction with ROS for simulating robotic systems and environments. It provides a 3D 
            simulation environment where you can model and simulate robots, sensors, and other objects.
•	Steering a robot usually involves controlling its motion and trajectory is obtained .

•	In ROS,the TF (Transform) system is a core component used to manage and broadcast the relationships between coordinate frames in a robot or robotic system. The TF system helps to keep track of the positions 
            and orientations of different components and sensors with respect to a common reference frame. The relationships between frames are represented as a tree, known as the TF tree.
